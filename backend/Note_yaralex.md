## FAQ

**What is the cost of Yaralex for creators?**  
Signing up is free. Yaralex only takes a small percentage of subscription sales to support the platform.  

**Can creators set their own subscription prices?**  
Yes! Tutors have full control to set their subscription tiers and offer coupons or discounts.  

**How does Yaralex compare to other learning games like Duolingo?**  
Unlike Duolingo, which provides generic content, Yaralex empowers tutors to create and monetize their own custom, gamified content.  

**What does a customized app mean?**  
Creators can use or generate their own content and fully personalize their app — from colors, themes, and avatars to graphics — to match their brand and style.
